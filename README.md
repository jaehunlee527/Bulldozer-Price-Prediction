### Bulldozer Bluebook Price Prediction
This is the regression analysis predicting the sales price of bulldozers. The data files are provided by the [Kaggle Competition - Blue Book for Bulldozers](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview). It was a competition that Kaggle hosted several years ago.

### Data 
Data.zip is compressed CSV files containing train and valid set files. 

### Summary

#### EDA
Each row in the trainset had 52 columns of features. They include sales information such as sale date and auctioneer ID as well as product information like model ID.

#### Imputation
For numerical columns, some numbers of 'YearMade' feature had value == 1000, which should be considered as missing. I created a dictionary of modelID: mode of yearmade, and replaced these missing entries.

For categorical columns, I dropped all features that are more than 70% missing and had more than 10 distinct values. A lot of columns were heavily missing the entries. (Few of them over 90%) There may be two possible reasons why these features are missing: 1) they are missing for no particular reason - perhaps failure to fill them out on the form 2) these features are not pertinent to the models being sold. To account for the first type of loss, I replicated the same approach as 'YearMade' column impuation, where I filled in the most frequent categorical value with respect to the models. When I saw that there still were missing entires, I imputed them with "other", as they probably should be considered as a different category.

#### Encoding
For any categorical columns with number of unique values fewer or equal to 4, I used one hot encoding. Else, I used target encoding, based on the finding that values in categorical columns were showing strong correlation with the target.
